# Masters-Cricket

This repository contains Julia code to run the exponential varying-hazard model for measuring batting ability in cricket, as seen in the following manuscript:

* Stevenson O. G., & Brewer, B. J. (2017). Bayesian Survival Analysis of batsmen in Test cricket. *Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports*, *13*(1), 25-36.

Additionally, Julia code is provided to run the more flexible Gaussian hazard model.

## Data
A fake data set is provided for a player who has batted for 1000 innings. The first column indicates the number of runs scored, while the second indicates whether or not the player remained not-out (indicated by a 1, 0 otherwise).
